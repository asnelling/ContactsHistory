# Contacts History

An attempt at an Android app that lists contacts sorted in descending order of last update. The goal
here is to quickly see the most recently updated or created contacts. Unfortunately, it seems that
the "last update timestamp" gets reset every time the contacts are synchronized with the cloud.

Anyways, here's what I've come up with so far. If you find a way to get around the timestamps
resetting, please do open a ticket or submit a Pull Request.
